Oliver is a software engineer and occasional entrepreneur, currently working with Google in London.
He is interested in ambitious projects requiring elegant solutions to meaningful problems.

His key area of interest is in automation - not just testing execution, but also development, design
and even requirements and test specification.

He enjoys building things with Java, JavaScript, and occasionally Go, but wishes he could spare more
time for Haskell.
